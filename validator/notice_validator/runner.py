"""Runner — orchestrates rule evaluation.

Importing this module does NOT populate the rule registry — importing the
``notice_validator.rules`` package does (its __init__ imports every rule
module). validate() guards against an empty registry by failing closed
(RUNNER-0): a zero-rule run must never return a green result for arbitrary
input (mirrors skills/toms-art32/validator/toms_validator/runner.py).
